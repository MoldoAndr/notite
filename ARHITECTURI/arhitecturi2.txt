                        Zero Flag (ZF): This flag is set when the result of 
                        an operation is zero. For example, after performing
                        a subtraction, if the result is zero, the ZF flag is set.

                        Sign Flag (SF): This flag is set when the result of 
                        an operation is negative. It indicates whether the most 
                        significant bit of the result is set or not.

                        Carry Flag (CF): This flag is set when there is a 
                        carry or borrow in arithmetic operations such as 
                        addition or subtraction. It is also used in bitwise operations.

                        Overflow Flag (OF): This flag is set when the result 
                        of a signed operation overflows the range of a signed 
                        integer. It indicates that the result is too large or 
                        too small to be represented in the given number of bits.

                        Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF): This flag is used in binary-coded 
                        decimal (BCD) arithmetic operations. It is set when there 
                        is a carry from the lower nibble (4 bits) to the higher 
                        nibble during addition or subtraction.
