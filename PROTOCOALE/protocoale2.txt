MAC Address (Media Access Controll)
    - syntax: AB:CD:12:34:56:BB
    - unique identifier of a network controller
    - has 48-bits
        - first 24-bits : Organisationally Unique Identifier (OUI) - of the producer
            - first byte, last bit : unicast (0) / multicast (1) 
            - first byte, last but one bit : globally unique (0) / localy administred (1)
        - last 24-bits  : Network Interface Controller (NIC) Specific
    - roles : Identification, Layer 2 of the OSI, Switching, Security
    - broadcast MAC Address : FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

IP Address (Internet Protocol)
    - IPv4 standard : a.b.c.d  | a,b,c,d [0,255], a!=0          - 32-bit  - 4.3 bilion available
    - IPv6 standard : 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334   - 128-bit
    - unique for: Internet Service Providers
    - not unique for: Local Users
    - functions: 
            - identifies the host's network Interface
            - provide the location of the host in the network
    - subnetting: 
        - dividing the IPv4 address into more subnetworks
        - same subnet: same group of the most significant bytes
        - subnet mask : determines which part is the host portion 
                            and which part is the network portion

Firewall    - network security device or software application that monitors
                and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic 
                based on predetermined security rules
            - primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between
                a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks
            -types: 
                - Hardware Firewall: Typically a standalone device, 
                    such as a router or dedicated firewall appliance,
                    that is placed at the perimeter of a network to 
                    filter traffic before it enters or leaves the network.
                - Software Firewall: Installed on individual devices or servers, 
                    such as personal computers or servers, to filter traffic.
                    Operating systems often come with built-in firewall software 
                    that can be configured to control inbound and outbound traffic.
            - methods used:
                - Packet Filtering: Examines each packet of data passing 
                    through the firewall and decides whether to drop or 
                    allow it based on predetermined rules, such as source 
                    and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
                - Stateful Inspection (Stateful Firewall): Keeps track of 
                    the state of active connections and uses this information 
                    to make decisions about which packets to allow or block. 
                    This method offers better security by understanding the 
                    context of traffic flows.
                - Proxy Servers: Acts as an intermediary between internal and 
                    external networks, intercepting and inspecting traffic 
                    before forwarding it. Proxy servers can provide additional 
                    security by hiding internal IP addresses and filtering content
                - Application Layer Filtering: Analyzes traffic at the application
                    layer of the OSI model, allowing administrators to create more 
                    granular rules based on specific applications or services.

SSID    - Service Set Identifier.
        - unique identifier that allows wireless devices to connect 
            of a specific wireless network. 
        - when searching for available Wi-Fi networks on your device, 
            see a list of SSIDs representing different networks. 
        - each SSID is typically chosen by the network administrator or the owner 
            of the wireless router and can be customized to help users identify
            and distinguish between different networks.


NAT     - Network Address Translation
        - process used in computer networking to translate private IP
            addresses used within a local area network (LAN) into public IP addresses 
            used on the internet. 
        - allows multiple devices within a private network to share a 
            single public IP address, which helps conserve the limited number 
            of available public IP addresses
        - Static NAT: 
            - maps a private IP address to a single public 
                IP address on a one-to-one basis.
        - Dynamic NAT
            - maps private IP addresses to public IP addresses
                from a pool of available addresses on a
                one-to-one basis, dynamically assigning them as needed.
        - PAT (Port Address Translation) or NAT Overload
            - maps multiple private IP addresses to a single 
                public IP address using different port 
                numbers to distinguish between the connections.

Host    - any device or computer system 
            that is connected to a network and 
            can send or receive data

Unicast:
    - refers to a communication pattern where data is 
        sent from one sender to one specific receiver.
    - the sender knows the exact address 
        (typically the MAC address or IP address) of the intended recipient.
    - used in point-to-point communication scenarios, 
        such as when a user accesses a website or sends an email.

Multicast:
    - refers to a communication pattern where data is
        sent from one sender to multiple specific receivers 
        who have expressed interest in receiving the data
    - the sender sends a single copy of the data, 
        which is then replicated by the network infrastructure and 
        delivered to multiple recipients
    - often used for applications such as streaming multimedia content, 
        video conferencing, or distributing software 
        updates to multiple devices simultaneously.

Broadcast:
    - refers to a communication pattern where data 
        is sent from one sender to all devices within the network.
    - the sender sends a single copy of the data, 
        and it is delivered to every device within the network segment.
    - typically used for tasks such as network discovery, 
        where a device needs to find other devices or services 
        available on the network without knowing their specific addresses.
    - While broadcast can be useful for certain tasks, 
        it can also generate unnecessary network traffic if 
        not used judiciously, potentially impacting network performance.



Router
    Components of a router:
        - CPU 
        - ROM
        - Flash
        - Non-Volatile RAM
        - RAM
        - Interfaces 
        - Ports 
        - NAT
        - Firewall

Interface:
        - physical / logical
        - physical interfaces : ports
        - logical interfaces : logical interfaces
                        - provide additional functionality
                        - provide segmentation

Port:
        - specific endpoint
        - physical connector
        - always physical

Common Network Devices

    Hub:
        - basic networking device that connects multiple computers or 
        - other network devices in a local area network (LAN). 
        - It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
        - receive data packets from one device and broadcast them to all 
            other devices connected to the hub. 
        - all devices on the network receive the data, regardless 
            of whether it was intended for them or not.
        - have been replaced by switches, which offer better performance and efficiency.

    Router:
        - networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
        - operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.
        - analyze the destination IP addresses of incoming data packets and determine
            the best path for forwarding them to their destination. 
        - use routing tables and algorithms to make these decisions.
        - essential for connecting multiple networks together, 
            such as connecting a home network to the internet or connecting 
            different departments within a large organization.

    Switch:
        - networking device that connects devices within a LAN. 
        - operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
        - switches are more intelligent and can direct data packets specifically 
            to the device they are intended for, 
            rather than broadcasting them to all devices.
        - maintain a MAC address table to keep track of 
            which devices are connected to each of its ports, 
            allowing for more efficient data transmission within the network.

    Modem:
        - converts digital signals from a computer into analog signals that 
            can be transmitted over analog communication lines (such as telephone lines) and vice versa.
        - commonly used to connect computers or local networks to the 
            internet through an internet service provider (ISP). 
        - modulate and demodulate signals to enable communication over the 
            specific medium used by the ISP, such as DSL, cable, or fiber optic lines.

    Access Point (AP):
        - device that allows wireless devices to connect to a 
            wired network using Wi-Fi. 
        - acts as a central transmitter and receiver of wireless radio signals within a specified range.
        - commonly used to provide wireless connectivity in homes, 
            offices, and public spaces, allowing devices like laptops, 
            smartphones, and tablets to access network resources without the need for physical cables
